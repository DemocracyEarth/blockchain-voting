# blockchain-voting
This is an empty, placeholder repo for a [Waffle board](https://waffle.io/DemocracyEarth/blockchain-voting). Two repos compose this board:  `/vote` and `social-smart-contract`. The two are intimately related. The VOTE token will be at the core of our liquid democracy and it represents the actual vote transactions between users. The Social Smart Contract is the backend implementation of liquid democracy via smart contracts.
